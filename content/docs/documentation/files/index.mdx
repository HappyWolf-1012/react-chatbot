The file upload feature allows you to upload a file to be used for training your chatbot. This process enhances the chatbot's knowledge and capabilities by incorporating additional information from the uploaded file. You can select and upload a relevant file, which the system will then use to train the chatbot, improving its responses and interactions based on the content of the file.
